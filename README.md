# Signalsmith Audio's DSP Library

A C++11 header-only library, providing classes/templates for (mostly audio) signal-processing tasks.

```
git clone https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/code/dsp.git
```

⚠️ It's fairly early in development, so (while the parts which exist should be well-tested) the APIs might change.

### Documentation

Docs are on the web: https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/code/dsp/

### Development / contributing

Tests (and source-scripts for the above docs) are available in a separate repo:

```
git clone https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/code/dsp-doc.git
```

The goal (where possible) is to measure/test the actual audio characteristics of the tools (e.g. frequency responses and aliasing levels).
